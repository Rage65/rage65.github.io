            <p>I wanted to listen to some older CarTalk episodes but they did not have a readily available archive. This sent me down a rabbit hole on trying to find these old episodes. I was going through some Reddit posts and found a URL that showed about a month's worth of episodes from 2018, and I started messing with the URL and the packets/requests sent to the webserver. Eventually, I figured out how to modify the URL to scroll through the different months, but it was still tedious messing with the URL. So, I built a Python script to download all the possible combinations of that URL and then combine them, then pull out the link that actually links to the episode. Using that, I was able to build this site!</p>

            <h3>How to download the whole archive (requires python3)</h3>
            <p>1. Download my downloader script</p>
            <a href="list.py" download="fetch.py"><div class="download-button">Download my script</div></a> 
            <p>2. Install dependencies </p>
            <pre><button class="copy-button1" data-clipboard-target="#code-block-1">Copy</button><code id="code-block-1" class="language-js">pip install beautifulsoup4 requests tqdm lxml</code></pre>
            <p>3. Run it</p> 
            <pre><button class="copy-button1" data-clipboard-target="#code-block-2">Copy</button><code id="code-block-2" class="language-js">python3 fetch.py</code></pre>
            <p>4. Download this script and paste it in the HTML folder</p>
            <a href=""><div class="download-button">Download the script</div></a>
            <p>5. open terminal in the HTML directory. Then run it.</p>
            <pre><button class="copy-button1" data-clipboard-target="#code-block-3">Copy</button><code id="code-block-3" class="language-js">python3 download.py</code></pre>

            <pre><button class="copy-button1" data-clipboard-target="#code-block-4">Copy</button><code id="code-block-4" class="language-js">python3 download.py</code></pre>
            <p>5. All the epesodes should be in the audio folder!</p>
            <center><p>To add on new epesodes do not delete anything and just run fetch.py again in the same folder you previously ran it in (probobally downloads)</p></center>
            <p>Note: It is normal to be stuck on a blinking cursur for a while! The script is not stuck!</p>
