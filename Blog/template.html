        <p>1 or 2 years ago, my school received an empty arcade machine cabinet from a company that shut down. Some previous students thought it would be fun to turn it into a functional arcade machine and put it in the hall. They set it up with a simple Raspberry Pi and an old screen. I guess that worked fine enough, but when I joined, I wanted to take it to the next level and get it in the hall as soon as possible. I first started by installing Batocera Linux on an old 4th gen intel hp pc. I replaced the Raspberry Pi 3 with that and installed a newer LCD panel screen. I also installed a ton of games.

Now we had a working cabenet, but it still looked kinda bland, and for some games I needed to use the keyboard. I fixed this by installing LED string lights behind the sign. I installed some actually kiinda good sounding office speaker i found in ewaste. I also installed some more buttons hooked up to a raspberry pi pico, to serve as configurable buttons for actions not covered by the existing controller.

Finally, I signed my name in it, and installed a backboard on it. It was ready to be installed in the halls, but it was a challenge to find a spot. Finally, we found a spot that worked, and now its ready to be enjoyed!
